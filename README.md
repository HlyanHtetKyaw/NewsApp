Android Developer Coding Test 
============================================

I've created a public repository in Github and can clone the master branch with "Clone with HTTPS".
This application includes 2 screens : News List Screen and News Detail Screen.

News list screen displays the list of news from API using "bitcoin" as initial parameter and load 50 news per page.
That query parameter can be changeable by search bar and list can be refreshed when users pull to refresh.
In the News Detail Screen, the screen will show the user the news he clicked from the News List Screen. 
Both screens can load data with or without any network connection.
